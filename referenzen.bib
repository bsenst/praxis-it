	abstract="Background: Approximately 262 million people worldwide are affected by asthma, and the overuse of reliever medication---specifically, short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) overuse---is common. This can lead to adverse health effects. A smartphone app, the Asthma app, was developed via a participatory design to help patients gain more insight into their SABA use through monitoring and psychoeducation. Objective: This pilot study aims to evaluate the feasibility and usability of the app. The preliminary effects of using the app after 3 months on decreasing asthma symptoms and improving quality of life were examined. Methods: A mixed methods study design was used. Quantitative data were collected using the app. Asthma symptoms (measured using the Control of Allergic Rhinitis and Asthma Test) and the triggers of these symptoms were collected weekly. Quality of life (36-Item Short-Form Health Survey) was assessed at baseline and after 3, 6, and 12 months. User experience (System Usability Scale) was measured at all time points, except for baseline. Furthermore, objective user data were collected, and qualitative interviews, focusing on feasibility and usability, were organized. The interview protocol was based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology framework. Qualitative data were analyzed using the Framework Method. Results: The baseline questionnaire was completed by 373 participants. The majority were female (309/373, 82.8{\%}), with a mean age of 46 (SD 15) years, and used, on average, 10 SABA inhalations per week. App usability was rated as good: 82.3 (SD 13.2; N=44) at 3 months. The Control of Allergic Rhinitis and Asthma Test score significantly improved at 3 months (18.5) compared with baseline (14.8; $\beta$=.189; SE 0.048; P<.001); however, the obtained score still indicated uncontrolled asthma. At 3 months, there was no significant difference in the quality of life. Owing to the high dropout rate, insufficient data were collected at 6 and 12 months and were, therefore, not further examined. User data showed that 335 users opened the app (250/335, 74.6{\%}, were returning visitors), with an average session time of 1 minute, and SABA registration was most often used (7506/13,081, 57.38{\%}). Qualitative data (from a total of 4 participants; n=2, 50{\%} female) showed that the participants found the app acceptable and clear. Three participants stated that gaining insight into asthma and its triggers was helpful. Two participants no longer used the app because they perceived their asthma as controlled and, therefore, did not use SABA often or only used it regularly based on the advice of the pulmonologist. Conclusions: The initial findings regarding the app's feasibility and usability are encouraging. However, the notable dropout rate underscores the need for a cautious interpretation of the results. Subsequent studies, particularly those focusing on implementation, should explore the potential integration of the app into standard treatment practices. ",

    abstract = {A time may be approaching when wise patients demand artificial intelligence (AI)–informed care as a standard of quality. How this expectation will be met remains unclear; indeed, AI may put the health system at a crossroads. Even at this formative stage, and despite limitations, predictive AI and large language models (LLMs) show potential for accurately diagnosing and prognosticating across domains, including medicine, pathology, and radiology.Yet traditional health care organizations (HCOs) grapple with the complexities of AI, from integrating it into rigid electronic health record (EHR) workflows to ensuring fairness and monitoring performance. HCOs are often constrained in innovation by entrenched operational structures. Deploying AI demands rigorous oversight, including surveillance for data drift and shift (ie, changes in data patterns that can degrade model performance), while promoting fairness, transparency, and avoidance of bias. Meanwhile, an emerging direct-to-consumer (DTC) health care market bypasses traditional HCOs. For example, Amazon integrates telehealth, primary care, and pharmacy services into its Prime membership. Additionally, Big Pharma host consumer-facing portals streamlining access to medications and integrating telehealth consultations.},

    abstract = {Adherence to long-term therapies in chronic disease is poor. Traditional interventions to improve adherence are complex and not widely effective. Mobile telephone text messaging may be a scalable means to support medication adherence.To conduct a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials to assess the effect of mobile telephone text messaging on medication adherence in chronic disease.MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, and CINAHL (from database inception to January 15, 2015), as well as reference lists of the articles identified. The data were analyzed in March 2015.Randomized clinical trials evaluating a mobile telephone text message intervention to promote medication adherence in adults with chronic disease.Two authors independently extracted information on study characteristics, text message characteristics, and outcome measures as per the predefined protocol.Odds ratios and pooled data were calculated using random-effects models. Risk of bias and study quality were assessed as per Cochrane guidelines. Disagreement was resolved by consensus.Sixteen randomized clinical trials were included, with 5 of 16 using personalization, 8 of 16 using 2-way communication, and 8 of 16 using a daily text message frequency. The median intervention duration was 12 weeks, and self-report was the most commonly used method to assess medication adherence. In the pooled analysis of 2742 patients (median age, 39 years and 50.3\% [1380 of 2742] female), text messaging significantly improved medication adherence (odds ratio, 2.11; 95\% CI, 1.52-2.93; P \&lt; .001). The effect was not sensitive to study characteristics (intervention duration or type of disease) or text message characteristics (personalization, 2-way communication, or daily text message frequency). In a sensitivity analysis, our findings remained robust to change in inclusion criteria based on study quality (odds ratio, 1.67; 95\% CI, 1.21-2.29; P = .002). There was moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 62\%) across clinical trials. After adjustment for publication bias, the point estimate was reduced but remained positive for an intervention effect (odds ratio, 1.68; 95\% CI, 1.18-2.39).Mobile phone text messaging approximately doubles the odds of medication adherence. This increase translates into adherence rates improving from 50\% (assuming this baseline rate in patients with chronic disease) to 67.8\%, or an absolute increase of 17.8\%. While promising, these results should be interpreted with caution given the short duration of trials and reliance on self-reported medication adherence measures. Future studies need to determine the features of text message interventions that improve success, as well as appropriate patient populations, sustained effects, and influences on clinical outcomes.},

The CDA is an ANSI approved document architecture for exchange of clinical information using XML. In phase I of the SCIPHOX project the proposal specifies the use of the CDA as a generalized international standard in the national context of discharge and referral letters in Germany. The specification defines how to use the CDA header and associated vocabularies by providing a translation and interpretation of the CDA header tags and provides a solution for taking local needs (insurance information etc.) into account.}

	abstract = {Introduction
	Immunization information systems (IISs) are highly effective for increasing vaccination rates but information about how primary care physicians use them is limited.
	Methods
	Pediatricians, family physicians (FPs), and general internists (GIMs) were surveyed by e-mail and mail from January 2015 to April 2015 from all states with an existing IIS. Providers were recruited to be representative of national provider organization memberships. Multivariable log binomial regression examined factors associated with IIS use (October 2015–April 2016).
	Results
	Response rates among pediatricians, FPs, and GIMs, respectively, were 75% (325/435), 68% (310/459), and 63% (272/431). A proportion of pediatricians (5%), FPs (14%), and GIMs (48%) did not know there was a state/local IIS; 81%, 72%, and 27% reported using an IIS (p<0.0001). Among those who used IISs, 64% of pediatricians, 61% of FPs, and 22% of GIMs thought the IIS could tell them a patient’s immunization needs; 22%, 29%, and 51% did not know. The most frequently reported major barriers to use included the IIS not updating the electronic medical record (29%, 28%, 35%) and lack of ability to submit data electronically (22%, 27%, 31%). Factors associated with lower IIS use included FP (adjusted risk ratio=0.85; 95% CI=0.75, 0.97) or GIM (adjusted risk ratio=0.33; 95% CI=0.25, 0.42) versus pediatric specialty and older versus younger provider age (adjusted risk ratio=0.96; 95 CI%=0.94, 0.98).
	Conclusions
	There are substantial gaps in knowledge of IIS capabilities, especially among GIMs; barriers to interoperability between IISs and electronic medical records affect all specialties. Closing these gaps may increase use of proven IIS functions including decision support and reminder/recall.}

	abstract = {Background. WeChat is the most widely and frequently used mobile social media in China and has profoundly integrated into the daily life of many Chinese people. A variety of medicine-related information may be found on WeChat. As users of WeChat, doctors often access health-related information and even provide a variety of medical services or participate in various types of mobile communication with patients. Objective. This study is the first attempt to quantitatively explore the approaches by doctors of acquiring medical knowledge using Internet resources especially social media such as WeChat to access knowledge. Methods. A self-administered questionnaire was designed, distributed, collected, and analyzed utilizing the online survey tool Sojump. WeChat was adopted to randomly release the questionnaires using snowball sampling and collect the results after a certain amount of time. Results. 292 valid questionnaires out of 314 questionnaires by clinical doctors were analyzed. Regarding the current status of accessing medical knowledge among doctors, more than 60\% of the doctors regularly used the Internet to search for medical knowledge, 19.86\% used WeChat as a channel to acquire medical knowledge, and only 23.97\% were satisfied with acquiring medical knowledge through the Internet. Regarding the frequency of WeChat usage, nearly 40\% of the doctors accessed WeChat more than 20 times per day and over 70\% used WeChat for over half an hour every day. Regarding the status of accessing medical knowledge through WeChat, nearly half (47.26\%) of the doctors stated that they often read professional medical articles on WeChat and the most common channel is friends’ moment sharing and public account subscriptions, with selection rates of 59.93\% and 60.27\%, respectively. The most desirable mode of acquiring medical knowledge through WeChat was the following: “professional medical knowledge from peers, with a reminder.” Conclusion. WeChat has become a nonnegligible means of acquiring medical knowledge for busy Chinese physicians in a mobile environment. Further evaluation and improvement of the quality of medical knowledge on WeChat are needed. The recommendation of individualized articles through social media may become another contributing factor for doctors to acquire medical knowledge effectively and efficiently.},

	abstract = {Objective To investigate the potential of deep learning for automatically delineating (segmenting) laryngeal cancer superficial extent on endoscopic images and videos. Methods A retrospective study was conducted extracting and annotating white light (WL) and Narrow-Band Imaging (NBI) frames to train a segmentation model (SegMENT-Plus). Two external datasets were used for validation. The model's performances were compared with those of two otolaryngology residents. In addition, the model was tested on real intraoperative laryngoscopy videos. Results A total of 3933 images of laryngeal cancer from 557 patients were used. The model achieved the following median values (interquartile range): Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) = 0.83 (0.70–0.90), Intersection over Union (IoU) = 0.83 (0.73–0.90), Accuracy = 0.97 (0.95–0.99), Inference Speed = 25.6 (25.1–26.1) frames per second. The external testing cohorts comprised 156 and 200 images. SegMENT-Plus performed similarly on all three datasets for DSC (p = 0.05) and IoU (p = 0.07). No significant differences were noticed when separately analyzing WL and NBI test images on DSC (p = 0.06) and IoU (p = 0.78) and when analyzing the model versus the two residents on DSC (p = 0.06) and IoU (Senior vs. SegMENT-Plus, p = 0.13; Junior vs. SegMENT-Plus, p = 1.00). The model was then tested on real intraoperative laryngoscopy videos. Conclusion SegMENT-Plus can accurately delineate laryngeal cancer boundaries in endoscopic images, with performances equal to those of two otolaryngology residents. The results on the two external datasets demonstrate excellent generalization capabilities. The computation speed of the model allowed its application on videolaryngoscopies simulating real-time use. Clinical trials are needed to evaluate the role of this technology in surgical practice and resection margin improvement. Level of Evidence III Laryngoscope, 134:2826–2834, 2024},

Participants described substantial changes in medical practice due to electronic communication, including perceived patient expectations to receive rapid responses to portal secure messages. They described portal secure messaging as useful for building relationships with patients, but also reported that electronic message management has created new stressors, including erosion of work-life boundaries and anxiety associated with unlimited inbox volume. Individual PCPs used a diverse array of strategies, including multitasking during and outside work and delegating to medical assistants. Chiefs described group-level strategies, including reserving clinic time for inbox management, coverage systems for vacation and sick days, physician-to-physician training, and interdisciplinary teams to share messaging work.Individual physicians and local practice groups have developed a wide array of strategies for electronic inbox management. The volume of electronic messages and PCPs’ perceptions that patients expect rapid responses have created new stressors in primary care practice. Medical groups and health systems can support PCPs by facilitating knowledge transfer among physicians about inbox management strategies and further developing team structures for inbox coverage.},

	abstract = {Introduction
	Secure messaging is a relatively new addition to health information technology (IT). Several studies have examined the impact of secure messaging on (clinical) outcomes but very few studies have examined the impact on workflow in primary care clinics. In this study we examined the impact of secure messaging on workflow of clinicians, staff and patients.
	Methods
	We used a multiple case study design with multiple data collections methods (observation, interviews and survey).
	Results
	Results show that secure messaging has the potential to improve communication and information flow and the organization of work in primary care clinics, partly due to the possibility of asynchronous communication. However, secure messaging can also have a negative effect on communication and increase workload, especially if patients send messages that are not appropriate for the secure messaging medium (for example, messages that are too long, complex, ambiguous, or inappropriate). Results show that clinicians are ambivalent about secure messaging. Secure messaging can add to their workload, especially if there is high message volume, and currently they are not compensated for these activities. Staff is −especially compared to clinicians- relatively positive about secure messaging and patients are overall very satisfied with secure messaging. Finally, clinicians, staff and patients think that secure messaging can have a positive effect on quality of care and patient safety.
	Conclusion
	Secure messaging is a tool that has the potential to improve communication and information flow. However, the potential of secure messaging to improve workflow is dependent on the way it is implemented and used.}

	abstract="Background: Following a 2010-2011 pilot intervention in which a limited sample of primary care doctors offered their patients secure Web-based portal access to their office visit notes, the participating sites expanded OpenNotes to nearly all clinicians in primary care, medical, and surgical specialty practices. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the ongoing experiences and perceptions of patients who read ambulatory visit notes written by a broad range of doctors, nurses, and other clinicians. Methods: A total of 3 large US health systems in Boston, Seattle, and rural Pennsylvania conducted a Web-based survey of adult patients who used portal accounts and had at least 1 visit note available in a recent 12-month period. The main outcome measures included patient-reported behaviors and their perceptions concerning benefits versus risks. Results: Among 136,815 patients who received invitations, 21.68{\%} (29,656/136,815) responded. Of the 28,782 patient respondents, 62.82{\%} (18,081/28,782) were female, 72.90{\%} (20,982/28,782) were aged 45 years or older, 76.94{\%} (22,146/28,782) were white, and 14.30{\%} (4115/28,782) reported fair or poor health. Among the 22,947 who reported reading 1 or more notes, 3 out of 4 reported reading them for 1 year or longer, half reported reading at least 4 notes, and 37.74{\%} (8588/22,753) shared a note with someone else. Patients rated note reading as very important for helping take care of their health (16,354/22,520, 72.62{\%}), feeling in control of their care (15,726/22,515, 69.85{\%}), and remembering the plan of care (14,821/22,516, 65.82{\%}). Few were very confused (737/22,304, 3.3{\%}) or more worried (1078/22,303, 4.83{\%}) after reading notes. About a third reported being encouraged by their clinicians to read notes and a third told their clinicians they had read them. Less educated, nonwhite, older, and Hispanic patients, and individuals who usually did not speak English at home, were those most likely to report major benefits from note reading. Nearly all respondents (22,593/22,947, 98.46{\%}) thought Web-based access to visit notes a good idea, and 62.38{\%} (13,427/21,525) rated this practice as very important for choosing a future provider. Conclusions: In this first large-scale survey of patient experiences with a broad range of clinicians working in practices in which shared notes are well established, patients find note reading very important for their health management and share their notes frequently with others. Patients are rarely troubled by what they read, and those traditionally underserved in the United States report particular benefit. However, fewer than half of clinicians and patients actively address their shared notes during visits. As the practice continues to spread rapidly in the United States and internationally, our findings indicate that OpenNotes brings benefits to patients that largely outweigh the risks. ",

	ABSTRACT = {The healthcare landscape is facing serious changes driven by digitalization and its VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous) conditions. These disrupt the stability of the old order and its static routines. In addition, the global pandemic, technological advances, and patients’ desire for customer rights are reinforcing the need for an accelerated paradigm shift in established healthcare organizations. However, most healthcare organizations are still struggling to close the digitalization gap. They are unprepared to evolve into dynamic VUCA service organizations. To help healthcare organizations to better understand and adapt to the new conditions, we propose an IT-based multi-perspective analysis process enabling holistic understanding and decision-making to derive customized digitalization strategies. To achieve this, it is essential to develop a semantic layer of knowledge mapping and integration. This article introduces the GOLD Framework and its corresponding IT-tool support to derive a holistic understanding based on selecting and connecting suitable methods/theories and guiding the users in their correct use. The required formalization of the IT-tool support ensures consistency and is the basis for continuous improvement. The approach covers the complete process, from sensing new opportunities and/or threats to seizing organization-specific strategies to transforming towards digitally enabled service organizations. Its novelty is threefold: (1) It offers a new level of shared understanding and stakeholder alignment by making the holistic dependencies visible and tangible; (2) it guides the diverse stakeholders step by step; (3) and is based on a standardized approach which however also enables and supports the customization of steps and guidance to better suit the targeted domain and its needs.},

  abstract="Background: The status of the digitalization of companies and institutions is usually measured using maturity models. However, the concept of maturity in general practice is currently unclear, and herewith we examine the question of how maturity can be measured. There is a lack of empirical work on the dimensions and subcategories of digital maturity that provide information on the assessment framework. Objective: The aim of the study was to answer the question of how many and which dimensions and subcategories describe digital maturity in general practice. Methods: An explorative, qualitative research design based on semistructured expert interviews was used to investigate the dimensions of digital maturity. Twenty experts from various areas of the health care sector (care providers, interest groups, health care industry, and patient organizations) were interviewed. The interviews were analyzed based on a content-structuring analysis according to Kuckartz and R{\"a}diker using MAXQDA software (VERBI GmbH). Results: In total, 6 dimensions with a total of 26 subcategories were identified. Of these, 4 dimensions with a total of 16 subcategories (1) digitally supported processes, (2) practice staff, (3) organizational structures and rules, and (4) technical infrastructure and were deductively linked to digital maturity. In addition to the use of digital solutions, digital maturity included, for example, individual, organizational, and technical capabilities and resources of the medical practice. The 2 further dimensions, (5) benefits and outcomes and (6) external framework conditions of the medical practice, were identified inductively with a total of 10 subcategories. Digital maturity was associated with the beneficial use of digitalization, for example, with efficiency benefits for the practice, and external framework conditions were associated with influencing factors such as the local patient situation in the medical practice. Conclusions: The results indicate that digital maturity is a multidimensional construct that is associated with many dimensions and variables. It is a holistic approach with human, organizational, and technical factors and concerns the way digitalization is used to shape patient care and processes. Furthermore, it is related to the maturity of the organizational environment as well as the benefits of a digitalized medical practice; however, this still needs to be confirmed. To measure the level of digital maturity in outpatient care as accurately as possible, maturity models should therefore be multilayered and take external influencing factors into account. Future research should statistically validate the identified dimensions. At the same time, correlations and dependencies between the measurement dimensions and their subcategories should be analyzed.

	abstract = {Purpose
	The impact of the ambulatory electronic health record (EHR) on physician productivity is poorly understood. Fear of productivity loss remains a major concern for practitioners and health care delivery organizations and inhibits system adoption. This study describes the changes in physician productivity after the implementation of a commercially available ambulatory EHR system in a large academic multi-specialty physician group.
	Methods
	Weill Cornell faculty members implemented on the EpicCare (Epic Systems) EHR between 2001 and 2007 were identified as potential study participants. Monthly visit volume, charges, and work relative value units (wRVUs) were compared pre and post each provider's EHR implementation go-live date. Practitioners who lacked at least 6 months of pre- and post-implementation visit volume and charge data were excluded. Practitioners who did not meet pre-determined system proficiency metrics were additionally identified and became the basis of a non-adopter comparison group.
	Results
	203 physicians met criteria for the analysis. The eligible providers were divided into an adopter and non-adopter cohort based on system proficiency benchmarks. Those practitioners who adopted the EHR had a statistically significant increase in average monthly patient visit volume of 9 visits per provider per month. The non-adopter cohort's visit volume was statistically unchanged. Both the EHR adopters and non-adopters had statistically significant increases (22% and 16% respectively) in average monthly charges in the post-implementation period. Average monthly wRVUs were statistically unchanged in the non-adopter cohort, but showed a positive and statistically significant increase of 12 wRVUs per provider per month for the adopter group. The EHR adoption group showed an incremental increase in productivity once practitioners achieved 6 or more months experience with the EHR, consistent with a “ramp-up” period. A multivariable regression model did not reveal any association between the post-EHR implementation change in wRVUs and several potential confounding variables, including baseline provider average monthly visit volume and wRVUs, date of system adoption, and specialty categorization.
	Conclusion
	Provider productivity, as measured by patient visit volume, charges, and wRVUs modestly increased for a cohort of multi-specialty providers that adopted a commercially available ambulatory EHR. The productivity gain appeared to become even more pronounced after several months of system experience. This objective data may help persuade apprehensive practitioners that EHR adoption need not harm productivity. The baseline differences in productivity metrics for the adopters and non-adopters in our study suggest that there are fundamental differences in these groups. Further characterizing these differences may help predict EHR adoption success and guide future implementation strategies.}

	abstract="Background: Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) using web-based diabetes management platforms has demonstrated promise in managing type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the effectiveness of such systems incorporating algorithm-guided insulin titration has not been extensively studied in Asian populations. Objective: This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of the ALRT telehealth solution---a US Food and Drug Administration--cleared, web-based platform that integrates SMBG with algorithm-driven insulin dose adjustments---in improving glycemia in insulin-treated T2D. Methods: This 24-week, pre-post intervention study enrolled 25 adults with T2D (mean age 58.9, SD 7.0 y; n=14, 56{\%} male) on twice-daily premixed insulin. Inclusion criteria included a baseline hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level between 7.5{\%} to 9.9{\%} (58‐86 mmol/mol), a BMI ≤40 kg/m{\texttwosuperior}, and experience with SMBG. Participants uploaded twice-daily SMBG data weekly via a mobile app, which generated insulin titration recommendations based on a predefined algorithm. Physicians reviewed and approved the recommendations, which were then communicated back to participants via the app. The primary outcome was the change in HbA1c level from baseline to 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes included changes in fasting plasma glucose, insulin dose, hypoglycemia incidence, and SMBG adherence. Results: Participants achieved significant reductions in HbA1c level from 8.6{\%} (70 mmol/mol) at baseline to 7.4{\%} (57 mmol/mol) at 24 weeks (P<.001), with reductions of 0.8{\%} and 0.4{\%} in the first and second 12 weeks, respectively. Fasting plasma glucose decreased from 8.7 (SD 2.0) mmol/L to 7.1 (SD 1.4) mmol/L (P<.001). Mean total daily insulin dose increased modestly from 0.73 (SD 0.31) units/kg/day to 0.79 (SD 0.34) units/kg/day (P=.007). Participants demonstrated high adherence, completing 97.3{\%} (327/336) of prescribed SMBG measurements. During the study, 48{\%} (12/25) of participants experienced at least 1 hypoglycemia episode, predominantly mild hypoglycemia (85/96, 88.5{\%}; glucose 3.0‐3.9 mmol/L). Hypoglycemia episodes increased from 24 during weeks 0‐12 to 72 during weeks 13‐24. There were no episodes of severe hypoglycemia requiring external assistance. BMI increased slightly from 29.0 (SD 3.6) kg/m{\texttwosuperior} to 29.5 (SD 3.6) kg/m{\texttwosuperior} (P=.03), reflecting a modest weight gain associated with improved glycemia. Conclusions: In conclusion, patients with insulin-treated T2D initiated on a web-based glucose monitoring system with algorithm-guided dosing recommendations showed significant improvement in glycemic control compared to baseline. High adherence rates underscore the feasibility of integrating algorithm-guided insulin titration into routine care. While hypoglycemia incidence rose slightly, episodes were predominantly mild, and no severe events occurred. This intervention shows promise for broader adoption in T2D management, particularly in resource-constrained settings. ",

  abstract="Background: Digital technologies are shaping medicine and public health. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the attitudes toward and the use of digital technologies for health-related purposes using a nationwide survey. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study using a panel sample of internet users selected from the general population living in Germany. Responses to a survey with 28 items were collected using computer-assisted telephone interviews conducted in October 2020. The items were divided into four topics: (1) general attitudes toward digitization, (2) COVID-19 pandemic, (3) physical activity, and (4) perceived digital health (eHealth) literacy measured with the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS; sum score of 8=lowest to 40=highest perceived eHealth literacy). The data were analyzed in IBM-SPSS24 using relative frequencies. Three univariate multiple regression analyses (linear or binary logistic) were performed to investigate the associations among the sociodemographic factors (age, gender, education, and household income) and digital technology use. Results: The participants included 1014 internet users (n=528, 52.07{\%} women) aged 14 to 93 years (mean 54, SD 17). Among all participants, 66.47{\%} (674/1014) completed up to tertiary (primary and secondary) education and 45.07{\%} (457/1017) reported a household income of up to 3500 Euro/month (1 Euro=US {\$}1.18). Over half (579/1014, 57.10{\%}) reported having used digital technologies for health-related purposes. The majority (898/1014, 88.56{\%}) noted that digitization will be important for therapy and health care, in the future. Only 25.64{\%} (260/1014) reported interest in smartphone apps for health promotion/prevention and 42.70{\%} (433/1014) downloaded the COVID-19 contact-tracing app. Although 52.47{\%} (532/1014) reported that they come across inaccurate digital information on the COVID-19 pandemic, 78.01{\%} (791/1014) were confident in their ability to recognize such inaccurate information. Among those who use digital technologies for moderate physical activity (n=220), 187 (85.0{\%}) found such technologies easy to use and 140 (63.6{\%}) reported using them regularly (at least once a week). Although the perceived eHealth literacy was high (eHEALS mean score 31 points, SD 6), less than half (43.10{\%}, 400/928) were confident in using digital information for health decisions. The use of digital technologies for health was associated with higher household income (odds ratio [OR] 1.28, 95{\%} CI 1.11-1.47). The use of digital technologies for physical activity was associated with younger age (OR 0.95, 95{\%} CI 0.94-0.96) and more education (OR 1.22, 95{\%} CI 1.01-1.46). A higher perceived eHealth literacy score was associated with younger age ($\beta$=--.22, P<.001), higher household income ($\beta$=.21, P<.001), and more education ($\beta$=.14, P<.001). Conclusions: Internet users in Germany expect that digitization will affect preventive and therapeutic health care in the future. The facilitators and barriers associated with the use of digital technologies for health warrant further research. A gap exists between high confidence in the perceived ability to evaluate digital information and low trust in internet-based information on the COVID-19 pandemic and health decisions. ",

    abstract = {Rapid digitalization of health care and a dearth of digital health education for medical students and junior physicians worldwide means there is an imperative for more training in this dynamic and evolving field.To develop an evidence-informed, consensus-guided, adaptable digital health competencies framework for the design and development of digital health curricula in medical institutions globally.A core group was assembled to oversee the development of the Digital Health Competencies in Medical Education (DECODE) framework. First, an initial list was created based on findings from a scoping review and expert consultations. A multidisciplinary and geographically diverse panel of 211 experts from 79 countries and territories was convened for a 2-round, modified Delphi survey conducted between December 2022 and July 2023, with an a priori consensus level of 70\%. The framework structure, wordings, and learning outcomes with marginal percentage of agreement were discussed and determined in a consensus meeting organized on September 8, 2023, and subsequent postmeeting qualitative feedback. In total, 211 experts participated in round 1, 149 participated in round 2, 12 participated in the consensus meeting, and 58 participated in postmeeting feedback.The DECODE framework uses 3 main terminologies: domain, competency, and learning outcome. Competencies were grouped into 4 domains: professionalism in digital health, patient and population digital health, health information systems, and health data science. Each competency is accompanied by a set of learning outcomes that are either mandatory or discretionary. The final framework comprises 4 domains, 19 competencies, and 33 mandatory and 145 discretionary learning outcomes, with descriptions for each domain and competency. Six highlighted areas of considerations for medical educators are the variations in nomenclature, the distinctiveness of digital health, the concept of digital health literacy, curriculum space and implementation, the inclusion of discretionary learning outcomes, and socioeconomic inequities in digital health education.This evidence-informed and consensus-guided framework will play an important role in enabling medical institutions to better prepare future physicians for the ongoing digital transformation in health care. Medical schools are encouraged to adopt and adapt this framework to align with their needs, resources, and circumstances.},

Not surprisingly, the best way to prepare future physicians for this reality remains uncertain; the tools and technologies that will dominate in the next decade are evolving rapidly. In the face of this uncertainty, international frameworks like the Digital Health Competencies in Medical Education (DECODE) offer welcome guidance. After preliminary work, more than 200 international experts participated in a 2-round Delphi process, ultimately yielding a final DECODE framework with 19 competencies, 33 mandatory learning outcomes, and 145 discretionary learning outcomes covering a broad range of topics from bias in machine learning algorithms to digital health literacy. This comprehensive framework is intended to support medical educators from diverse geographies in equipping their students to navigate current and emerging technologies. A companion perspective to keep in mind, and well served by this framework, is the need to prepare our students for a future where patients are cocreators of their care, enabled by technology and empowered with reliable information.},

abstract="Background: Early weight loss is an established predictor for treatment outcomes in weight management interventions for people with obesity. However, there is a paucity of additional, reliable, and clinically actionable early predictors in weight management interventions. Novel blended-care weight management interventions combine coach and app support and afford new means of structured, continuous data collection, informing research on treatment adherence and outcome prediction. Objective: Against this backdrop, this study analyzes app engagement as a predictor for weight loss in large-scale, real-world, blended-care interventions. We hypothesize that patients who engage more frequently in app usage in blended-care treatment (eg, higher logging activity) lose more weight than patients who engage comparably less frequently at 3 and 6 months of intervention. Methods: Real-world data from 19,211 patients in obesity treatment were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were treated with 3 different blended-care weight management interventions, offered in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Germany by a digital behavior change provider. The principal component analysis identified an overarching metric for app engagement based on app usage. A median split informed a distinction in higher and lower engagers among the patients. Both groups were matched through optimal propensity score matching for relevant characteristics (eg, gender, age, and start weight). A linear regression model, combining patient characteristics and app-derived data, was applied to identify predictors for weight loss outcomes. Results: For the entire sample (N=19,211), mean weight loss was --3.24{\%} (SD 4.58{\%}) at 3 months and --5.22{\%} (SD 6.29{\%}) at 6 months. Across countries, higher app engagement yielded more weight loss than lower engagement after 3 but not after 6 months of intervention (P3 months<.001 and P6 months=.59). Early app engagement within the first 3 months predicted percentage weight loss in Switzerland and Germany, but not in the United Kingdom (PSwitzerland<.001, PUnited Kingdom=.12, and PGermany=.005). Higher age was associated with stronger weight loss in the 3-month period (PSwitzerland=.001, PUnited Kingdom=.002, and PGermany<.001) and, for Germany, also in the 6-month period (PSwitzerland=.09, PUnited Kingdom=.46, and PGermany=.03). In Switzerland, higher numbers of patients' messages to coaches were associated with higher weight loss (P3 months<.001 and P6 months<.001). Messages from coaches were not significantly associated with weight loss (all P>.05). Conclusions: Early app engagement is a predictor of weight loss, with higher engagement yielding more weight loss than lower engagement in this analysis. This new predictor lends itself to automated monitoring and as a digital indicator for needed or adapted clinical action. Further research needs to establish the reliability of early app engagement as a predictor for treatment adherence and outcomes. In general, the obtained results testify to the potential of app-derived data to inform clinical monitoring practices and intervention design. ",

	abstract = {Background The extension to which digital technologies are employed to promote the delivery of high-quality healthcare is known as Digital Maturity. Individuals{\textquoteright} and systems{\textquoteright} digital maturity are both necessary to ensure a successful, scalable and sustainable digital transformation in healthcare. Digital maturity in primary care has been scarcely evaluated.Objectives This study assessed the digital maturity - as a whole and in its dimensions - in General Practice and evaluated how participants{\textquoteright} demographic characteristics, practice characteristics and features of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) use are associated with digital maturity.Methods General Practitioners (GPs) across 20 countries completed an online questionnaire between June and September 2020. Demographic data, practice characteristics and features of EHRs use were collected. Digital maturity was evaluated through a framework built upon usage, resources and ability (divided in this study in its collective and individual components), interoperability, general evaluation methods and impact of digital technologies. Each dimension was rated as 1 or 0. The digital maturity score is the sum of the six dimensions and ranges from 0 to 6 (maximum digital maturity). Multivariable linear regression was used to model the total score, while multivariable logistic regression was used to model the probability of meeting each dimension of the score.Results 1,600 GPs (61\% female, 68\% Europeans) participated. GPs had a median digital maturity of 4 (P25-P75: 3-5). Positive associations with digital maturity were found for: being male (B=0.18 [95\%CI 0.01;0.36]), use of EHRs for longer periods (B=0.45 [95\%CI 0.35;0.54]) and higher frequencies of access to EHRs (B=0.33 [95\%CI 0.17;0.48]). Practising in a rural setting was negatively associated with digital maturity (B=-0.25 [95\%CI -0.43;-0.08]). Usage (90\%) was the most acknowledged dimension while interoperability (47\%) and use of best practice general evaluation methods (28\%) were the least. Shorter durations of EHRs use were negatively associated with all digital maturity dimensions (aOR from 0.09 to 0.77).Conclusions Our study demonstrated notable factors that impact digital maturity and exposed discrepancies in digital transformation across healthcare settings. It provides a roadmap for policymakers to develop more efficacious interventions to hasten and take the best advantage of digital transformation in General Practice.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis project is supported by a grant from the European General Practice Research Network.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate if an electronic health record (EHR) self-scheduling function was associated with changes in mammogram completion for primary care patients who were eligible for a screening mammogram using U.S. Preventive Service Task Force recommendations.
Methods
This was a retrospective cohort study (September 1, 2014–August 31, 2019, analyses completed in 2022) using a difference-in-differences design to examine mammogram completion before versus after the implementation of self-scheduling. The difference-in-differences estimate was the interaction between time (pre-versus post-implementation) and group (active EHR patient portal versus inactive EHR patient portal). The primary outcome was mammogram completion among all eligible patients, with completion defined as receiving a mammogram within 6 months post-visit. The secondary outcome was mammogram completion among patients who received a clinician order during their visit.
Results
The primary analysis included 35,257 patient visits. The overall mammogram completion rate in the pre-period was 22.2% and 49.7% in the post-period. EHR self-scheduling was significantly associated with increased mammogram completion among those with an active EHR portal, relative to patients with an inactive portal (adjusted difference 13.2 percentage points [95% CI 10.6–15.8]). For patients who received a clinician mammogram order at their eligible visit, self-scheduling was significantly associated with increased mammogram completion among patients with an active EHR portal account (adjusted difference 14.7 percentage points, [95% CI 10.9–18.5]).
Conclusions
EHR-based self-scheduling was associated with a significant increase in mammogram completion among primary care patients. Self-scheduling can be a low-cost, scalable function for increasing preventive cancer screenings.}

  abstract = {Background: The digital shift toward remote consultations in general practice needs ongoing monitoring to understand its impact on general practice organizations and the wider health care system. Objective: This study aimed to explore how remote consultations impact on contracted general practitioner (GP) practices and how GPs perceive the implications of this uptake for the overall health care system. Methods: In total, 5 focus groups were conducted with a total of 18 GPs from all 4 health regions of Norway in 2022. The material was subjected to Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis. Results: The analysis yielded six themes: (1) the design of novel effective clinical pathways: remote consultations empower GPs to tailor new effective clinical trajectories, blending modalities to address diverse needs across clinical episodes---from initial triage, through investigations to case closure; (2) increased workday flexibility: remote consultations introduce variability into daily work, allowing GPs to adjust patient contact intensity, and leading to a less stressful work-home balance; (3) erosion of organizational boundaries: easy remote access to GPs appears to reduce patients' tolerance for minor illness and self-care, hindering effective gatekeeping and shifting GPs' focus from proactive to more reactive work, increasing work-related stress; (4) degradation of clinical shrewdness: confronted with an increasing amount of unsorted and trivial remote inquiries, GPs observe challenges in detecting and prioritizing serious cases; (5) dilemmas related to responsibility, ethics, and legislation: remote consultations highlight a tension for contract GPs between legal responsibilities and ethical obligations, with implications for patients with limited health literacy; this may entail suboptimal evaluation or delayed treatment---potentially contributing to increased health care inequity; and (6) retaining clinical core values in a changing world. Overall, GPs affirm that remote consultations have come to stay and describe efforts to effectively manage the advantages and disadvantages inherent in such interactions to safeguard clinical effectiveness and organizational sustainability of primary health care. Conclusions: The widespread adoption of remote consultations in the Norwegian contract GP scheme fundamentally reshapes the dynamics of GP work and the overall health care system. Awareness and proactive management of these changes are essential for maintaining sustainable, high-quality primary health care.},

Their progress in digitalization can be described by the concept of digital maturity and measured using maturity models. The aim of this scoping review is to provide an overview of the state of research on digital maturity and its measurement in primary care, specifically for GPs. The scoping review was conducted according to Arksey and O’Malley, considering the reporting scheme for PRISMA-ScR. For the literature search, we used PubMed and Google Scholar as the main sources of information. A total of 24 international, mostly Anglo-American studies, were identified. The understanding of digital maturity varied widely. In most studies, it was understood in a highly technical way and associated with the adoption of electronic medical records. More recent, but mostly unpublished, studies have attempted to capture overall digital maturity. So far, the understanding of digital maturity of GPs is still very diffuse—the research literature is still in its infancy. Future research should therefore aim to explore the dimensions of digital maturity of GPs to be able to develop a consistent and validated model for measuring digital maturity.}}

METHODS: We inter-viewed EMR physician champions from 20 solo/small group practices to understand different types of EMR users and their EMR-related costs and benefits. RESULTS: Interviewees differed greatly in the EMR-related benefits they generated. These differences were associated with how they used the EMR, and the amount of effort they invested in making changes to complement EMR use. We defined five types of physician EMR users: Viewers, Basic Users, Strivers, Arrivers, and System Changers. The majority of interviewees were Strivers and Arrivers, physicians who have already invested substantial time in numerous process changes that help generate EMR-related benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Incentives and comprehensive support services for facilitating complementary process changes could be important for moving physicians from one user group to another. Additional research is needed to verify this user typology and to further define the relationship between user types and EMR-generated financial and quality benefits.}}

In the light of an apparent lack of empirically based integrated accounts surrounding these issues, this interpretative review aims to provide an overview and extract potentially generalizable findings across settings.    Methods  We conducted a systematic search and critique of the empirical literature published between 1997 and 2010. In doing so, we searched a range of medical databases to identify review papers that related to the implementation and adoption of eHealth applications in organizational settings. We qualitatively synthesized this literature extracting data relating to technologies, contexts, stakeholders, and their inter-relationships.    Results  From a total body of 121 systematic reviews, we identified 13 systematic reviews encompassing organizational issues surrounding health information technology implementations. By and large, the evidence indicates that there are a range of technical, social and organizational considerations that need to be deliberated when attempting to ensure that technological innovations are useful for both individuals and organizational processes. However, these dimensions are inter-related, requiring a careful balancing act of strategic implementation decisions in order to ensure that unintended consequences resulting from technology introduction do not pose a threat to patients.    Conclusions  Organizational issues surrounding technology implementations in healthcare settings are crucially important, but have as yet not received adequate research attention. This may in part be due to the subjective nature of factors, but also due to a lack of coordinated efforts toward more theoretically-informed work. Our findings may be used as the basis for the development of best practice guidelines in this area.}}

Unfortunately, many of these practices are making little effective use of this technology. Recent White Papers, The New NHS and Information for Health place an even greater emphasis upon the effective use of information and its associated technology. This paper describes a model for the assessment and managed change of information management maturity within general practice. The model, known as GPIMM (General Practice Information Maturity Model), which has been developed from related models in fields such as software quality and diffusion of innovation, provides a framework for the assessment of the maturity of information processes within general practice. The model can also be used to define key tasks in terms of training and information strategies to facilitate practice development. The model and its antecedents are described, and it is shown how this model can be used to assess and improve information processes within case study practices. This paper then goes on to examine the health librarians’ role in the process of change and discuss the metaphor of a ‘virtual library’ as a means to shift the agenda from information technology to information itself.}}

Design  Mixed-methods study.  Setting  Manitoba.  Participants  Health care providers and staff in 5 primary care offices.  Methods  Level of EMR adoption was assessed, and field notes from interviews and discussion groups were qualitatively analyzed for common challenges and themes across all sites.  Main findings  Fifty-seven interviews and 4 discussion groups were conducted from November 2011 to January 2012. Electronic medical record adoption scores ranged from 2.3 to 3.0 (out of a theoretical maximum of 5). Practices often scored lower than expected on use of decision support, providing patients with access to their own data, and use of practice-reporting tools. Qualitative analysis showed there were ceiling effects to EMR adoption owing to how the EMR was implemented, the supporting eHealth infrastructure, lack of awareness or availability of EMR functionality, and poor EMR data quality.  Conclusion  Many practitioners used their EMRs as “electronic paper records” and were not using advanced features of their EMRs that could further enhance practice. Data-quality issues within the EMRs could affect future attempts at using these features. Education and quality improvement activities to support data quality and EMR optimization are likely needed to support practices in maximizing their use of EMRs.}}

The authors study the differences in individual physicians’ EHR use patterns and identify perceptions of uncertainty as an important new variable in understanding EHR use. Design Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews and direct observation of physicians (n=28) working in a multispecialty outpatient care organization. Measurements We identified physicians’ perceptions of uncertainty as an important variable in understanding differences in EHR use patterns. Drawing on theories from the medical and organizational literatures, we identified three categories of perceptions of uncertainty: reduction, absorption, and hybrid. We used an existing model of EHR use to categorize physician EHR use patterns as high, medium, and low based on degree of feature use, level of EHR-enabled communication, and frequency that EHR use patterns change. Results Physicians’ perceptions of uncertainty were distinctly associated with their EHR use patterns. Uncertainty reductionists tended to exhibit high levels of EHR use, uncertainty absorbers tended to exhibit low levels of EHR use, and physicians demonstrating both perspectives of uncertainty (hybrids) tended to exhibit medium levels of EHR use. Conclusions We find evidence linking physicians’ perceptions of uncertainty with EHR use patterns.

Extensive literature exists about how to assess the components of digital maturity, but it has not been used to design a comprehensive framework for evaluation. Consequently, the measurement systems that do exist are limited to evaluating digital programs within one service or care setting, meaning that digital maturity evaluation is not accounting for the needs of patients across their care pathways. Objective: The objective of our study was to identify the best methods and metrics for evaluating digital maturity and to create a novel, evidence-based tool for evaluating digital maturity across patient care pathways. Methods: We systematically reviewed the literature to find the best methods and metrics for evaluating digital maturity. We searched the PubMed database for all papers relevant to digital maturity evaluation. Papers were selected if they provided insight into how to appraise digital systems within the health service and if they indicated the factors that constitute or facilitate digital maturity. Papers were analyzed to identify methodology for evaluating digital maturity and indicators of digitally mature systems. We then used the resulting information about methodology to design an evaluation framework. Following that, the indicators of digital maturity were extracted and grouped into increasing levels of maturity and operationalized as metrics within the evaluation framework. Results: We identified 28 papers as relevant to evaluating digital maturity, from which we derived 5 themes. The first theme concerned general evaluation methodology for constructing the framework (7 papers). The following 4 themes were the increasing levels of digital maturity: resources and ability (6 papers), usage (7 papers), interoperability (3 papers), and impact (5 papers). The framework includes metrics for each of these levels at each stage of the typical patient care pathway. Conclusions: The framework uses a patient-centric model that departs from traditional service-specific measurements and allows for novel insights into how digital programs benefit patients across the health system.

There have been two major drivers for the HIS investments in healthcare: The ever-increasing burden from chronic disease with costs growing significantly faster and the recognition of the need for greatly improved quality and safety in health delivery. Maturity models (MM) are based on the premises that people, organizations, functional areas and processes evolve through a process of development or growth towards a more advanced maturity, going through a distinct number of levels. Through a state-of-the-art review of HIS, focused on their maturity state, we identify and characterize a set of critical factors recognized as determinants in the context of HIS maturity. The article identifies a broad spectrum of MM applied to the health sector and its characteristics and reinforces the belief that the maturity of HIS can contribute to the quality of information and knowledge management in the sector.}}

This poses challenges for leaders of digital transformation programmes—most importantly, how to set clear targets in the absence of an agreed basis for assessing current achievements or desired final goals. The rapid, continual emergence of new technologies adds further complexity. Internationally, the most widely used assessment of digital excellence is the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) Electronic Medical Record Adoption Model (EMRAM).6HIMSS Legacy WorkgroupHistory of the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society.https://www.himss.org/sites/himssorg/files/HIMSSorg/Content/files/HistoryHIMSS_January2013.pdfDate: 2012Date accessed: February 21, 2019Google Scholar This model maps out eight stages, from 0 to 7, for the adoption and utilisation of electronic medical record (EMR) functions culminating with HIMSS Level 7 (no use of paper charts, CPOE/CDSS [Computerized Provider Order Entry and Clinical Decision Support System] used in over 90% of the hospital). HIMSS Level 7 remains an uncommon achievement. For example, despite substantial federal investment through the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act,7Blumenthal D Launching HITECH.N Engl J Med. 2010; 362: 382-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar only 6% of US hospitals have achieved HIMSS Level 7.8Cohen JK How many hospitals are on each stage of HIMSS Analytics' EMR adoption model?.https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/ehrs/how-many-hospitals-are-on-each-stage-of-himss-analytics-emr-adoption-model.htmlDate: April 16, 2018Date accessed: February 21, 2019Google Scholar Various related frameworks have also been developed, including the HIMSS Analytics Infrastructure Adoption Model (INFRAM) and the Continuity of Care Maturity Model (CCMM). NHS England has adapted EMRAM, adding dimensions of interoperability, technological readiness, and infrastructure components to create a Digital Maturity Index to assess hospitals' digital capabilities. The key limitations of HIMSS EMRAM (and related approaches) are an almost exclusive focus on technological functionality rather than human and organisational capabilities and a failure to ensure that these are contextualised as enablers of transformation. HIMSS EMRAM also focuses on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of data exchange within hospitals rather than with other health-care organisations or settings such as primary and social care, which is fundamental to the provision of integrated care—often thereby neglecting innovation in service delivery models and social innovation. The portrayal of a single pathway towards excellence, achieved through a series of stages, might also unhelpfully distort priorities. Thus, a hospital could achieve HIMSS EMRAM Level 7 by having a closed-loop prescribing and administration system, but lack expertise in maintaining it or interrogating the data it generates. Additionally the costs of achieving closed-loop prescribing, which might be justified in terms of improving safety within a hospital, might not be the most pressing priority when considering patient pathways across an integrated health service. Although cost is a key driver for procuring digital systems in health care, which might be reinforced by models such as HIMSS EMRAM Level 7, focusing purely on technological capabilities, increasing evidence now also suggests that cost savings are unlikely to materialise and that the introduction of complex systems can have undesired consequences. Improving safety and quality might therefore be more realistic goals. The notion of digital excellence serves an important purpose, providing a vision that can help motivate stakeholders and coordinate activities towards the pursuit of the quadruple aims of improving population health, controlling costs, enhancing patient experience, and improving the working life of health-care providers.9Bodenheimer T Sinsky C From triple to quadruple aim: care of the patient requires care of the provider.Ann Fam Med. 2014; 12: 573-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar However, new frameworks for assessing digital maturity in relation to these complex and often contradictory goals are needed. These frameworks should facilitate setting clear targets and establishing ways to assess progress across diverse providers and settings, while also being agile by allowing targets to be updated throughout this journey. In doing so, we offer an alternative framework of measuring digital excellence where digital maturity can be tailored to the needs of local populations and build upon their existing institutional and technological infrastructures. This approach provides scope for adjustments over time in a context in which goalposts are changing, and where there is no agreed conception of direction and no endpoint (figure).10Pipek V Wulf V Infrastructuring: toward an integrated perspective on the design and use of information technology.J Assoc Inf Sys. 2009; 10: 306-332Google Scholar Our model takes these complexities into account. Here, different settings need to make constant re-assessments of their existing and desired digital state over time as goals, IT solutions, and policies change. This model could involve local providers identifying their own priorities and periodically reassessing these against their locally defined or desired outcomes. Large-scale digital change programmes need to take these localised dimensions of digital maturity into account—for example, by adjusting endpoints of envisioned future states according to local factors. Use of HIMSS Level 7 as a measurement of success for all organisations is likely to lead to disillusionment among those involved as health-care organisations might become frustrated with their local needs not being met and policy makers might become frustrated by mandated targets not being met.

This systematic review aims to identify relevant frameworks and synthesize their recommendations into DHT-specific content to be considered when performing Health Technology Assessments (HTAs) for DHTs that manage chronic noncommunicable disease at home. METHODS Searches were undertaken of Medline, Embase, Econlit, CINAHL, and The Cochrane Library (January 2015 to March 2020), and relevant gray literature (January 2015 to August 2020) using keywords related to HTA, evaluation frameworks, and DHTs. Included framework reference lists were searched from 2010 until 2015. The EUNetHTA HTA Core Model version 3.0 was selected as a scaffold for content evaluation. RESULTS Forty-four frameworks were identified, mainly covering clinical effectiveness (n = 30) and safety (n = 23) issues. DHT-specific content recommended by framework authors fell within 28 of the 145 HTA Core Model issues. A further twenty-two DHT-specific issues not currently in the HTA Core Model were recommended. CONCLUSIONS Current HTA frameworks are unlikely to be sufficient for assessing DHTs. The development of DHT-specific content for HTA frameworks is hampered by DHTs having varied benefit and risk profiles. By focusing on DHTs that actively monitor/treat chronic noncommunicable diseases at home, we have extended DHT-specific content to all nine HTA Core Model domains. We plan to develop a supplementary evaluation framework for designing research studies, undertaking HTAs, and appraising the completeness of HTAs for DHTs.}}

Many of these challenges have an under-examined ethical dimension. In this paper, we present a novel framework, Planning and Evaluating Remote Consultation Services (PERCS), built from a literature review and ongoing research. PERCS has 7 domains—the reason for consulting, the patient, the clinical relationship, the home and family, technologies, staff, the healthcare organization, and the wider system—and considers how these domains interact and evolve over time as a complex system. It focuses attention on the organization’s digital maturity and digital inclusion efforts. We have found that both during and beyond the pandemic, policymakers envisaged an efficient, safe and accessible remote consultation service delivered through state-of-the art digital technologies and implemented via rational allocation criteria and quality standards. In contrast, our empirical data reveal that strategic decisions about establishing remote consultation services, allocation decisions for appointment type (phone, video, e-, face-to-face), and clinical decisions when consulting remotely are fraught with contradictions and tensions—for example, between demand management and patient choice—leading to both large- and small-scale ethical dilemmas for managers, support staff and clinicians. These dilemmas cannot be resolved by standard operating procedures or algorithms. Rather, they must be managed by attending to here-and-now practicalities and emergent narratives, drawing on guiding principles applied with contextual judgement. We complement the PERCS framework with a set of principles for informing its application in practice, including education of professionals and patients.}}

Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and patient-reported experience measures (PREMs) are recommended as an essential part of comprehensive and multidisciplinary evaluation studies on telemedicine applications. For the first time, a systematic review has been conducted investigating the use of PROMs and PREMs in evaluation studies of telemedicine applications covering all application types and medical purposes. OBJECTIVE Our review investigates the following research questions: • In which scenarios were PROMs and PREMs collected for evaluation purposes? • Which PROM/PREM outcome domains have been covered and how often? • Which outcome measurement instruments (OMIs) have been used and how often? • Did the selection and quantity of PROMs and PREMs differ between study types and application types? • Has the use of PROMs and PREMs in evaluation studies changed over time? METHODS We conducted a systematic literature search in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and included studies published from inception until April 2, 2020. We included studies evaluating telemedicine applications with patients as main users; these studies reported PROMs and PREMs within randomized controlled trials (RCT), controlled trials, non-controlled trials and feasibility trials in English and German. RESULTS Out of 2671 records identified, 303 studies were included with 22.1% (67/303) feasibility studies, 23.1% (70/303) non-controlled trials, 6.6% (20/303) controlled trials and 48.2% (146/303) RCTs. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (n=310, mean=1.02, SD=1.05), emotional function (n=244, mean=0.81, SD=1.18) and adherence (n=103, mean=0.34, SD=0.53) were the most frequently assessed outcome domains. Self-developed PROMs were used in 21.4% (65/303) of all studies, self-developed PREMs were used in 22.3% (68/303). PROMs (n=884) were assessed more frequently than PREMs (n=234). As the evidence level of the studies increased, the number of PROMs also increased (τ=-0.45) with the number of PREMs decreasing (τ=0.35) at the same time. Since 2000, not only has the number of evaluation studies using PROMs/PREMs increased - the level of evidence and the number of OMIs used have also increased, with the number of PREMs permanently remaining at a lower level compared to the number of PROMs. CONCLUSIONS There have been increasingly more studies, particularly high-evidence studies, which use PROMs and PREMs to evaluate telemedicine applications. PROMs have been used more frequently than PREMs. With an increasing maturity stage of the telemedicine applications and higher evidence level, the use of PROMs increased in line with the recommendations of evaluation guidelines. HRQoL and emotional function were measured in almost all studies. Simultaneously, health literacy as a precondition for using the application adequately - alongside proper training and guidance - was rarely reported. Further efforts should be pursued for the standardization of PROM and PREM collection in evaluation studies of telemedicine applications.}}

Data were transcribed, coded thematically, and then analysed using the Planning and Evaluating Remote Consultation Services (PERCS) framework.With few exceptions, video consultations were either never adopted or soon abandoned in general practice despite a strong policy push, short-term removal of regulatory and financial barriers, and advances in functionality, dependability, and usability of video technologies (though some products remained 'fiddly' and unreliable). The relative advantage of video was perceived as minimal for most of the caseload of general practice, since many presenting problems could be sorted adequately and safely by telephone and in-person assessment was considered necessary for the remainder. Some patients found video appointments convenient, appropriate, and reassuring but others found a therapeutic presence was only achieved in person. Video sometimes added value for out-of-hours and nursing home consultations and statutory functions (for example, death certification).Efforts to introduce video consultations in general practice should focus on situations where this modality has a clear relative advantage (for example, strong patient or clinician preference, remote localities, out-of-hours services, nursing homes).}}

In Finland, the development of eHealth maturity has been systematically studied since 2003, through surveys conducted every 3 years. It has also been monitored in several international studies. The indicators used in these studies examined the availability of the electronic patient record, picture archiving and communication system, health information exchange, and other key eHealth functionalities. Objective The first aim is to study the national development in the maturity level of eHealth in primary health care and specialized care between 2011 and 2020 in Finland. The second aim is to clarify the regional differences in the maturity level of eHealth among Finnish hospital districts in 2020. Methods Data for this study were collected in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020, using web-based questionnaires from the Use of information and communication technology surveys in Finnish health care project. In total, 16 indicators were selected to describe the status of eHealth, and they were based on international eHealth studies and Finnish eHealth surveys in 3 areas: applications, regional integration, and data security and information and communications technology skills. The indicators remain the same in all the study years; therefore, the results are comparable. Results All the specialized care organizations (21/21, 100%) in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 participated in the study. The response rate among primary health care organizations was 86.3% (139/161) in 2011, 88.2% (135/153) in 2014, 85.8% (121/141) in 2017, and 95.6% (130/136) in 2020. At the national level, the biggest developments in eHealth maturity occurred between 2011 and 2014. The development has since continued, and some indicators have been saturated. Primary health care lags behind specialized care organizations, as measured by all the indicators and throughout the period under review. Regionally, there are differences among different types of organizations. Conclusions eHealth maturity has steadily progressed in Finland nationally, and its implementation has also been promoted through various national strategies and legislative changes. Some eHealth indicators have already been saturated and achieved an intensity of use rate of 100%. However, the scope for development remains, especially in primary health care. As Finland has long been a pioneer in the digitalization of health care, the results of this study show that the functionalities of eHealth will be adopted in stages, and deployment will take time; therefore, national eHealth strategies and legislative changes need to be implemented in a timely manner. The comprehensive sample size used in this study allows a regional comparison in the country, compared with previous country-specific international studies.}}

Individual and systemic digital maturity are both necessary to ensure a successful, scalable and sustainable digital transformation in healthcare. However, digital maturity in primary care has been scarcely evaluated. Objectives This study assessed the digital maturity in General Practice (GP) globally and evaluated its association with participants' demographic characteristics, practice characteristics and features of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) use. Methods GPs across 20 countries completed an online questionnaire between June and September 2020. Demographic data, practice characteristics, and features of EHRs use were collected. Digital maturity was evaluated through a framework based on usage, resources and abilities (divided in this study in its collective and individual components), interoperability, general evaluation methods and impact of digital technologies. Each dimension was rated as 1 or 0. The digital maturity score was calculated as the sum of the six dimensions and ranged between 0 to 6 (maximum digital maturity). Multivariable linear regression was used to model the total score, while multivariable logistic regression was used to model the probability of meeting each dimension of the score. Results One thousand six hundred GPs (61% female, 68% Europeans) participated. GPs had a median digital maturity of 4 (P25–P75: 3–5). Positive associations with digital maturity were found with: male gender [ B = 0.18 (95% CI 0.01; 0.36)], use of EHRs for longer periods [ B = 0.45 (95% CI 0.35; 0.54)] and higher frequencies of access to EHRs [ B = 0.33 (95% CI 0.17; 0.48)]. Practicing in a rural setting was negatively associated with digital maturity [ B = −0.25 (95%CI −0.43; −0.08)]. Usage (90%) was the most acknowledged dimension while interoperability (47%) and use of best practice general evaluation methods (28%) were the least. Shorter durations of EHRs use were negatively associated with all digital maturity dimensions (aOR from 0.09 to 0.77). Conclusion Our study demonstrated notable factors that impact digital maturity and exposed discrepancies in digital transformation across healthcare settings. It provides guidance for policymakers to develop more efficacious interventions to hasten the digital transformation of General Practice.}}

We have identified both commonalities and differences between practices in terms of how they: 1] manage the 'digital front door' (access and triage) and balance demand and capacity; 2] strive for high standards of quality and safety; 3] ensure digital inclusion and mitigate wider inequalities; 4] support and train their staff (clinical and non-clinical), students and trainees; 5] select, install, pilot and use technologies and the digital infrastructure which support them; and 6] involve patients in their improvement efforts.General practices' responses to pandemic-induced disruptive innovation appear unique and situated. We anticipate that by focusing on depth and detail, this longitudinal study will throw light on why a solution that works well in one practice does not work at all in another. As the study unfolds, we will explore how practices achieve timely diagnosis of urgent or serious illness and manage continuity of care, long-term conditions and complex needs.}}
