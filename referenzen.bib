Their progress in digitalization can be described by the concept of digital maturity and measured using maturity models. The aim of this scoping review is to provide an overview of the state of research on digital maturity and its measurement in primary care, specifically for GPs. The scoping review was conducted according to Arksey and O’Malley, considering the reporting scheme for PRISMA-ScR. For the literature search, we used PubMed and Google Scholar as the main sources of information. A total of 24 international, mostly Anglo-American studies, were identified. The understanding of digital maturity varied widely. In most studies, it was understood in a highly technical way and associated with the adoption of electronic medical records. More recent, but mostly unpublished, studies have attempted to capture overall digital maturity. So far, the understanding of digital maturity of GPs is still very diffuse—the research literature is still in its infancy. Future research should therefore aim to explore the dimensions of digital maturity of GPs to be able to develop a consistent and validated model for measuring digital maturity.}}

METHODS: We inter-viewed EMR physician champions from 20 solo/small group practices to understand different types of EMR users and their EMR-related costs and benefits. RESULTS: Interviewees differed greatly in the EMR-related benefits they generated. These differences were associated with how they used the EMR, and the amount of effort they invested in making changes to complement EMR use. We defined five types of physician EMR users: Viewers, Basic Users, Strivers, Arrivers, and System Changers. The majority of interviewees were Strivers and Arrivers, physicians who have already invested substantial time in numerous process changes that help generate EMR-related benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Incentives and comprehensive support services for facilitating complementary process changes could be important for moving physicians from one user group to another. Additional research is needed to verify this user typology and to further define the relationship between user types and EMR-generated financial and quality benefits.}}

In the light of an apparent lack of empirically based integrated accounts surrounding these issues, this interpretative review aims to provide an overview and extract potentially generalizable findings across settings.    Methods  We conducted a systematic search and critique of the empirical literature published between 1997 and 2010. In doing so, we searched a range of medical databases to identify review papers that related to the implementation and adoption of eHealth applications in organizational settings. We qualitatively synthesized this literature extracting data relating to technologies, contexts, stakeholders, and their inter-relationships.    Results  From a total body of 121 systematic reviews, we identified 13 systematic reviews encompassing organizational issues surrounding health information technology implementations. By and large, the evidence indicates that there are a range of technical, social and organizational considerations that need to be deliberated when attempting to ensure that technological innovations are useful for both individuals and organizational processes. However, these dimensions are inter-related, requiring a careful balancing act of strategic implementation decisions in order to ensure that unintended consequences resulting from technology introduction do not pose a threat to patients.    Conclusions  Organizational issues surrounding technology implementations in healthcare settings are crucially important, but have as yet not received adequate research attention. This may in part be due to the subjective nature of factors, but also due to a lack of coordinated efforts toward more theoretically-informed work. Our findings may be used as the basis for the development of best practice guidelines in this area.}}

Unfortunately, many of these practices are making little effective use of this technology. Recent White Papers, The New NHS and Information for Health place an even greater emphasis upon the effective use of information and its associated technology. This paper describes a model for the assessment and managed change of information management maturity within general practice. The model, known as GPIMM (General Practice Information Maturity Model), which has been developed from related models in fields such as software quality and diffusion of innovation, provides a framework for the assessment of the maturity of information processes within general practice. The model can also be used to define key tasks in terms of training and information strategies to facilitate practice development. The model and its antecedents are described, and it is shown how this model can be used to assess and improve information processes within case study practices. This paper then goes on to examine the health librarians’ role in the process of change and discuss the metaphor of a ‘virtual library’ as a means to shift the agenda from information technology to information itself.}}

Study Design and Setting  We summarize current understanding of scoping review publication rates, terms, definitions, and methods. We propose three recommendations for clarity in term, definition and methodology.    Results  We recommend adopting the terms “scoping review” or “scoping study” and the use of a proposed definition.

Design  Mixed-methods study.  Setting  Manitoba.  Participants  Health care providers and staff in 5 primary care offices.  Methods  Level of EMR adoption was assessed, and field notes from interviews and discussion groups were qualitatively analyzed for common challenges and themes across all sites.  Main findings  Fifty-seven interviews and 4 discussion groups were conducted from November 2011 to January 2012. Electronic medical record adoption scores ranged from 2.3 to 3.0 (out of a theoretical maximum of 5). Practices often scored lower than expected on use of decision support, providing patients with access to their own data, and use of practice-reporting tools. Qualitative analysis showed there were ceiling effects to EMR adoption owing to how the EMR was implemented, the supporting eHealth infrastructure, lack of awareness or availability of EMR functionality, and poor EMR data quality.  Conclusion  Many practitioners used their EMRs as “electronic paper records” and were not using advanced features of their EMRs that could further enhance practice. Data-quality issues within the EMRs could affect future attempts at using these features. Education and quality improvement activities to support data quality and EMR optimization are likely needed to support practices in maximizing their use of EMRs.}}

Physicians differ, however, in their use of this health information technology (IT), and these differences are not well understood. The authors study the differences in individual physicians’ EHR use patterns and identify perceptions of uncertainty as an important new variable in understanding EHR use. Design Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews and direct observation of physicians (n=28) working in a multispecialty outpatient care organization. Measurements We identified physicians’ perceptions of uncertainty as an important variable in understanding differences in EHR use patterns. Drawing on theories from the medical and organizational literatures, we identified three categories of perceptions of uncertainty: reduction, absorption, and hybrid. We used an existing model of EHR use to categorize physician EHR use patterns as high, medium, and low based on degree of feature use, level of EHR-enabled communication, and frequency that EHR use patterns change. Results Physicians’ perceptions of uncertainty were distinctly associated with their EHR use patterns. Uncertainty reductionists tended to exhibit high levels of EHR use, uncertainty absorbers tended to exhibit low levels of EHR use, and physicians demonstrating both perspectives of uncertainty (hybrids) tended to exhibit medium levels of EHR use. Conclusions We find evidence linking physicians’ perceptions of uncertainty with EHR use patterns. Study findings have implications for health IT research, practice, and policy, particularly in terms of impacting health IT design and implementation efforts in ways that consider differences in physicians’ perceptions of uncertainty.}}

Extensive literature exists about how to assess the components of digital maturity, but it has not been used to design a comprehensive framework for evaluation. Consequently, the measurement systems that do exist are limited to evaluating digital programs within one service or care setting, meaning that digital maturity evaluation is not accounting for the needs of patients across their care pathways. Objective: The objective of our study was to identify the best methods and metrics for evaluating digital maturity and to create a novel, evidence-based tool for evaluating digital maturity across patient care pathways. Methods: We systematically reviewed the literature to find the best methods and metrics for evaluating digital maturity. We searched the PubMed database for all papers relevant to digital maturity evaluation. Papers were selected if they provided insight into how to appraise digital systems within the health service and if they indicated the factors that constitute or facilitate digital maturity. Papers were analyzed to identify methodology for evaluating digital maturity and indicators of digitally mature systems. We then used the resulting information about methodology to design an evaluation framework. Following that, the indicators of digital maturity were extracted and grouped into increasing levels of maturity and operationalized as metrics within the evaluation framework. Results: We identified 28 papers as relevant to evaluating digital maturity, from which we derived 5 themes. The first theme concerned general evaluation methodology for constructing the framework (7 papers). The following 4 themes were the increasing levels of digital maturity: resources and ability (6 papers), usage (7 papers), interoperability (3 papers), and impact (5 papers). The framework includes metrics for each of these levels at each stage of the typical patient care pathway. Conclusions: The framework uses a patient-centric model that departs from traditional service-specific measurements and allows for novel insights into how digital programs benefit patients across the health system.

HIS has the potential to improve individuals’ health and providers’ performance by producing better quality, cost savings, and greater patient involvement in their own health. There have been two major drivers for the HIS investments in healthcare: The ever-increasing burden from chronic disease with costs growing significantly faster and the recognition of the need for greatly improved quality and safety in health delivery. Maturity models (MM) are based on the premises that people, organizations, functional areas and processes evolve through a process of development or growth towards a more advanced maturity, going through a distinct number of levels. Through a state-of-the-art review of HIS, focused on their maturity state, we identify and characterize a set of critical factors recognized as determinants in the context of HIS maturity. The article identifies a broad spectrum of MM applied to the health sector and its characteristics and reinforces the belief that the maturity of HIS can contribute to the quality of information and knowledge management in the sector.}}

This poses challenges for leaders of digital transformation programmes—most importantly, how to set clear targets in the absence of an agreed basis for assessing current achievements or desired final goals. The rapid, continual emergence of new technologies adds further complexity. Internationally, the most widely used assessment of digital excellence is the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) Electronic Medical Record Adoption Model (EMRAM).6HIMSS Legacy WorkgroupHistory of the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society.https://www.himss.org/sites/himssorg/files/HIMSSorg/Content/files/HistoryHIMSS_January2013.pdfDate: 2012Date accessed: February 21, 2019Google Scholar This model maps out eight stages, from 0 to 7, for the adoption and utilisation of electronic medical record (EMR) functions culminating with HIMSS Level 7 (no use of paper charts, CPOE/CDSS [Computerized Provider Order Entry and Clinical Decision Support System] used in over 90% of the hospital). HIMSS Level 7 remains an uncommon achievement. For example, despite substantial federal investment through the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act,7Blumenthal D Launching HITECH.N Engl J Med. 2010; 362: 382-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar only 6% of US hospitals have achieved HIMSS Level 7.8Cohen JK How many hospitals are on each stage of HIMSS Analytics' EMR adoption model?.https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/ehrs/how-many-hospitals-are-on-each-stage-of-himss-analytics-emr-adoption-model.htmlDate: April 16, 2018Date accessed: February 21, 2019Google Scholar Various related frameworks have also been developed, including the HIMSS Analytics Infrastructure Adoption Model (INFRAM) and the Continuity of Care Maturity Model (CCMM). NHS England has adapted EMRAM, adding dimensions of interoperability, technological readiness, and infrastructure components to create a Digital Maturity Index to assess hospitals' digital capabilities. The key limitations of HIMSS EMRAM (and related approaches) are an almost exclusive focus on technological functionality rather than human and organisational capabilities and a failure to ensure that these are contextualised as enablers of transformation. HIMSS EMRAM also focuses on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of data exchange within hospitals rather than with other health-care organisations or settings such as primary and social care, which is fundamental to the provision of integrated care—often thereby neglecting innovation in service delivery models and social innovation. The portrayal of a single pathway towards excellence, achieved through a series of stages, might also unhelpfully distort priorities. Thus, a hospital could achieve HIMSS EMRAM Level 7 by having a closed-loop prescribing and administration system, but lack expertise in maintaining it or interrogating the data it generates. Additionally the costs of achieving closed-loop prescribing, which might be justified in terms of improving safety within a hospital, might not be the most pressing priority when considering patient pathways across an integrated health service. Although cost is a key driver for procuring digital systems in health care, which might be reinforced by models such as HIMSS EMRAM Level 7, focusing purely on technological capabilities, increasing evidence now also suggests that cost savings are unlikely to materialise and that the introduction of complex systems can have undesired consequences. Improving safety and quality might therefore be more realistic goals. The notion of digital excellence serves an important purpose, providing a vision that can help motivate stakeholders and coordinate activities towards the pursuit of the quadruple aims of improving population health, controlling costs, enhancing patient experience, and improving the working life of health-care providers.9Bodenheimer T Sinsky C From triple to quadruple aim: care of the patient requires care of the provider.Ann Fam Med. 2014; 12: 573-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar However, new frameworks for assessing digital maturity in relation to these complex and often contradictory goals are needed. These frameworks should facilitate setting clear targets and establishing ways to assess progress across diverse providers and settings, while also being agile by allowing targets to be updated throughout this journey. In doing so, we offer an alternative framework of measuring digital excellence where digital maturity can be tailored to the needs of local populations and build upon their existing institutional and technological infrastructures. This approach provides scope for adjustments over time in a context in which goalposts are changing, and where there is no agreed conception of direction and no endpoint (figure).10Pipek V Wulf V Infrastructuring: toward an integrated perspective on the design and use of information technology.J Assoc Inf Sys. 2009; 10: 306-332Google Scholar Our model takes these complexities into account. Here, different settings need to make constant re-assessments of their existing and desired digital state over time as goals, IT solutions, and policies change. This model could involve local providers identifying their own priorities and periodically reassessing these against their locally defined or desired outcomes. Large-scale digital change programmes need to take these localised dimensions of digital maturity into account—for example, by adjusting endpoints of envisioned future states according to local factors. Use of HIMSS Level 7 as a measurement of success for all organisations is likely to lead to disillusionment among those involved as health-care organisations might become frustrated with their local needs not being met and policy makers might become frustrated by mandated targets not being met.

This systematic review aims to identify relevant frameworks and synthesize their recommendations into DHT-specific content to be considered when performing Health Technology Assessments (HTAs) for DHTs that manage chronic noncommunicable disease at home. METHODS Searches were undertaken of Medline, Embase, Econlit, CINAHL, and The Cochrane Library (January 2015 to March 2020), and relevant gray literature (January 2015 to August 2020) using keywords related to HTA, evaluation frameworks, and DHTs. Included framework reference lists were searched from 2010 until 2015. The EUNetHTA HTA Core Model version 3.0 was selected as a scaffold for content evaluation. RESULTS Forty-four frameworks were identified, mainly covering clinical effectiveness (n = 30) and safety (n = 23) issues. DHT-specific content recommended by framework authors fell within 28 of the 145 HTA Core Model issues. A further twenty-two DHT-specific issues not currently in the HTA Core Model were recommended. CONCLUSIONS Current HTA frameworks are unlikely to be sufficient for assessing DHTs. The development of DHT-specific content for HTA frameworks is hampered by DHTs having varied benefit and risk profiles. By focusing on DHTs that actively monitor/treat chronic noncommunicable diseases at home, we have extended DHT-specific content to all nine HTA Core Model domains. We plan to develop a supplementary evaluation framework for designing research studies, undertaking HTAs, and appraising the completeness of HTAs for DHTs.}}

Many of these challenges have an under-examined ethical dimension. In this paper, we present a novel framework, Planning and Evaluating Remote Consultation Services (PERCS), built from a literature review and ongoing research. PERCS has 7 domains—the reason for consulting, the patient, the clinical relationship, the home and family, technologies, staff, the healthcare organization, and the wider system—and considers how these domains interact and evolve over time as a complex system. It focuses attention on the organization’s digital maturity and digital inclusion efforts. We have found that both during and beyond the pandemic, policymakers envisaged an efficient, safe and accessible remote consultation service delivered through state-of-the art digital technologies and implemented via rational allocation criteria and quality standards. In contrast, our empirical data reveal that strategic decisions about establishing remote consultation services, allocation decisions for appointment type (phone, video, e-, face-to-face), and clinical decisions when consulting remotely are fraught with contradictions and tensions—for example, between demand management and patient choice—leading to both large- and small-scale ethical dilemmas for managers, support staff and clinicians. These dilemmas cannot be resolved by standard operating procedures or algorithms. Rather, they must be managed by attending to here-and-now practicalities and emergent narratives, drawing on guiding principles applied with contextual judgement. We complement the PERCS framework with a set of principles for informing its application in practice, including education of professionals and patients.}}

Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and patient-reported experience measures (PREMs) are recommended as an essential part of comprehensive and multidisciplinary evaluation studies on telemedicine applications. For the first time, a systematic review has been conducted investigating the use of PROMs and PREMs in evaluation studies of telemedicine applications covering all application types and medical purposes. OBJECTIVE Our review investigates the following research questions: • In which scenarios were PROMs and PREMs collected for evaluation purposes? • Which PROM/PREM outcome domains have been covered and how often? • Which outcome measurement instruments (OMIs) have been used and how often? • Did the selection and quantity of PROMs and PREMs differ between study types and application types? • Has the use of PROMs and PREMs in evaluation studies changed over time? METHODS We conducted a systematic literature search in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and included studies published from inception until April 2, 2020. We included studies evaluating telemedicine applications with patients as main users; these studies reported PROMs and PREMs within randomized controlled trials (RCT), controlled trials, non-controlled trials and feasibility trials in English and German. RESULTS Out of 2671 records identified, 303 studies were included with 22.1% (67/303) feasibility studies, 23.1% (70/303) non-controlled trials, 6.6% (20/303) controlled trials and 48.2% (146/303) RCTs. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (n=310, mean=1.02, SD=1.05), emotional function (n=244, mean=0.81, SD=1.18) and adherence (n=103, mean=0.34, SD=0.53) were the most frequently assessed outcome domains. Self-developed PROMs were used in 21.4% (65/303) of all studies, self-developed PREMs were used in 22.3% (68/303). PROMs (n=884) were assessed more frequently than PREMs (n=234). As the evidence level of the studies increased, the number of PROMs also increased (τ=-0.45) with the number of PREMs decreasing (τ=0.35) at the same time. Since 2000, not only has the number of evaluation studies using PROMs/PREMs increased - the level of evidence and the number of OMIs used have also increased, with the number of PREMs permanently remaining at a lower level compared to the number of PROMs. CONCLUSIONS There have been increasingly more studies, particularly high-evidence studies, which use PROMs and PREMs to evaluate telemedicine applications. PROMs have been used more frequently than PREMs. With an increasing maturity stage of the telemedicine applications and higher evidence level, the use of PROMs increased in line with the recommendations of evaluation guidelines. HRQoL and emotional function were measured in almost all studies. Simultaneously, health literacy as a precondition for using the application adequately - alongside proper training and guidance - was rarely reported. Further efforts should be pursued for the standardization of PROM and PREM collection in evaluation studies of telemedicine applications.}}

A total of 29 relevant articles were retrieved, representing 27 distinct maturity models. The articles were inductively analyzed, and the maturity model dimensions were extracted and consolidated into a maturity model framework.The consolidated maturity model framework consisted of 7 dimensions: strategy; information technology capability; interoperability; governance and management; patient-centered care; people, skills, and behavior; and data analytics. These 7 dimensions can be evaluated based on 24 respective indicators.The maturity model framework developed for this study can be used to assess digital maturity and identify areas for improvement.}}

Data were transcribed, coded thematically, and then analysed using the Planning and Evaluating Remote Consultation Services (PERCS) framework.With few exceptions, video consultations were either never adopted or soon abandoned in general practice despite a strong policy push, short-term removal of regulatory and financial barriers, and advances in functionality, dependability, and usability of video technologies (though some products remained 'fiddly' and unreliable). The relative advantage of video was perceived as minimal for most of the caseload of general practice, since many presenting problems could be sorted adequately and safely by telephone and in-person assessment was considered necessary for the remainder. Some patients found video appointments convenient, appropriate, and reassuring but others found a therapeutic presence was only achieved in person. Video sometimes added value for out-of-hours and nursing home consultations and statutory functions (for example, death certification).Efforts to introduce video consultations in general practice should focus on situations where this modality has a clear relative advantage (for example, strong patient or clinician preference, remote localities, out-of-hours services, nursing homes).}}

Several methods exist to assess and structurally develop digital maturity. However, it is notable that German hospitals lag behind the European average with respect to digitalization. Objective: We hypothesized that: (a) the perspective of hospital managing directors regarding the state of digitalization in German hospitals plays an important role in the investigation of barriers, and (b) the Hospital Future Act in 2020 may help to surmount those barriers. Methods: Aligned with the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES), two online surveys were conducted, one in 2019 and one in 2021. Results: The first study covered 184/344 hospitals and the second, 83/344. The responsibility for deciding on the implementation of digitalization lay with the management (115/184; 62.5%). About 54.9% (101/184) of the managing directors desired digitally supported workflows, together with employees or users. In total, 74.7% (62/83) of hospital managing directors expressed an increase in digitization compared to 2019, with a percentage increase of 25.4% (SD 14.41). In some cases, we analyzed the data using an ANOVA, chi-squared test and Pearson’s correlation, but there was no significant relation identified among the variables. Conclusions: This online-based survey study demonstrated that the development of a digitalization strategy is still strongly tied to or dominated by the attitude of the management. One could assume a lack of acceptance among employees, which should be surveyed in future research. The Hospital Future Act, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, has positively influenced the digital maturity of hospitals.}}

The indicators used in these studies examined the availability of the electronic patient record, picture archiving and communication system, health information exchange, and other key eHealth functionalities. Objective The first aim is to study the national development in the maturity level of eHealth in primary health care and specialized care between 2011 and 2020 in Finland. The second aim is to clarify the regional differences in the maturity level of eHealth among Finnish hospital districts in 2020. Methods Data for this study were collected in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020, using web-based questionnaires from the Use of information and communication technology surveys in Finnish health care project. In total, 16 indicators were selected to describe the status of eHealth, and they were based on international eHealth studies and Finnish eHealth surveys in 3 areas: applications, regional integration, and data security and information and communications technology skills. The indicators remain the same in all the study years; therefore, the results are comparable. Results All the specialized care organizations (21/21, 100%) in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 participated in the study. The response rate among primary health care organizations was 86.3% (139/161) in 2011, 88.2% (135/153) in 2014, 85.8% (121/141) in 2017, and 95.6% (130/136) in 2020. At the national level, the biggest developments in eHealth maturity occurred between 2011 and 2014. The development has since continued, and some indicators have been saturated. Primary health care lags behind specialized care organizations, as measured by all the indicators and throughout the period under review. Regionally, there are differences among different types of organizations. Conclusions eHealth maturity has steadily progressed in Finland nationally, and its implementation has also been promoted through various national strategies and legislative changes. Some eHealth indicators have already been saturated and achieved an intensity of use rate of 100%. However, the scope for development remains, especially in primary health care. As Finland has long been a pioneer in the digitalization of health care, the results of this study show that the functionalities of eHealth will be adopted in stages, and deployment will take time; therefore, national eHealth strategies and legislative changes need to be implemented in a timely manner. The comprehensive sample size used in this study allows a regional comparison in the country, compared with previous country-specific international studies.}}

Individuals’ and systems’ digital maturity are both necessary to ensure a successful, scalable and sustainable digital transformation in healthcare. Digital maturity in primary care has been scarcely evaluated. Objectives This study assessed the digital maturity - as a whole and in its dimensions - in General Practice and evaluated how participants’ demographic characteristics, practice characteristics and features of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) use are associated with digital maturity. Methods General Practitioners (GPs) across 20 countries completed an online questionnaire between June and September 2020. Demographic data, practice characteristics and features of EHRs use were collected. Digital maturity was evaluated through a framework built upon usage, resources and ability (divided in this study in its collective and individual components), interoperability, general evaluation methods and impact of digital technologies. Each dimension was rated as 1 or 0. The digital maturity score is the sum of the six dimensions and ranges from 0 to 6 (maximum digital maturity). Multivariable linear regression was used to model the total score, while multivariable logistic regression was used to model the probability of meeting each dimension of the score. Results 1,600 GPs (61% female, 68% Europeans) participated. GPs had a median digital maturity of 4 (P25-P75: 3-5). Positive associations with digital maturity were found for: being male (B=0.18 [95%CI 0.01;0.36]), use of EHRs for longer periods (B=0.45 [95%CI 0.35;0.54]) and higher frequencies of access to EHRs (B=0.33 [95%CI 0.17;0.48]). Practising in a rural setting was negatively associated with digital maturity (B=-0.25 [95%CI −0.43;-0.08]). Usage (90%) was the most acknowledged dimension while interoperability (47%) and use of best practice general evaluation methods (28%) were the least. Shorter durations of EHRs use were negatively associated with all digital maturity dimensions (aOR from 0.09 to 0.77). Conclusions Our study demonstrated notable factors that impact digital maturity and exposed discrepancies in digital transformation across healthcare settings. It provides a roadmap for policymakers to develop more efficacious interventions to hasten and take the best advantage of digital transformation in General Practice.}}

We are studying UK general practices as they try to balance remote and in-person care, with recurrent waves of COVID-19 and various post-pandemic backlogs.Mixed-methods (mostly qualitative) case study across 11 general practices. Researchers-in-residence have built relationships with practices and become familiar with their contexts and activities; they are following their progress for two years via staff and patient interviews, documents and ethnography, and supporting improvement efforts through co-design. In this paper, we report baseline data.Reflecting our maximum-variety sampling strategy, the 11 practices vary in size, setting, ethos, staffing, population demographics and digital maturity, but share common contextual features-notably system-level stressors such as high workload and staff shortages, and UK's technical and regulatory infrastructure. We have identified both commonalities and differences between practices in terms of how they: 1] manage the 'digital front door' (access and triage) and balance demand and capacity; 2] strive for high standards of quality and safety; 3] ensure digital inclusion and mitigate wider inequalities; 4] support and train their staff (clinical and non-clinical), students and trainees; 5] select, install, pilot and use technologies and the digital infrastructure which support them; and 6] involve patients in their improvement efforts.General practices' responses to pandemic-induced disruptive innovation appear unique and situated. We anticipate that by focusing on depth and detail, this longitudinal study will throw light on why a solution that works well in one practice does not work at all in another. As the study unfolds, we will explore how practices achieve timely diagnosis of urgent or serious illness and manage continuity of care, long-term conditions and complex needs.}}
